# Movie-Recommender-System
This is a movie recommender system project I completed as part of a Data Science course I am taking by ex-Amazon employee Frank Kane.

To get started:
- click on the green clone or download button. (This will let you download the code to your computer)
- go to Google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
- once everything is set up, click on File > Upload Notebook 
- upload the ItemBasedCF.ipynb file you downloaded earlier.
- You'll see the first code line of code says:
  from google.colab import files 
  uploaded = files.upload()
- click the play button next to the cell and this will ask you to upload a file. Upload the u.data file you downloaded earlier
- do the same thing for the u.item file. 
- This will upload the Movielens dataset to your notebook. 
- Follow the instructions and message me if you run into trouble. Best of luck!
